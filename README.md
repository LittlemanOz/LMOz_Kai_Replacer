A Freedom Wars mod that replaces Kai.

INSTALLATION 

Ps Vita Install: 

JP & EU Versions

(Note: I tested JP with English patch so it maybe slightly different).

1. Install Patch 1.20.
2. Install RePatch if you haven't already.
3. Move the folder "patch_v0120" from the repository into ux0:rePatch/PCSC00054 or for EU ux0:rePatch/PCSC00446.
4. Done!

   I haven't tested the US version but hopefully it should be simmilar.

Vita3k Install:

1. Install Patch 1.20.
2. Go to your Vita3k Directory open Programfiles.
3. Merge the folder "patch_v0120" from the repository into ux0/app/[Your version of Freedom Wars]/patch_v0120. Alternitively you can move just the file "Kai.xml" into the same location within the Patch folder.
4. Done!
